                                Our jewelry is made of 14k gold filled, 14k gold vermeil, and sterling silver - they're high quality and can last a lifetime with care! All of the materials will be listed under the item description. Read more about the <a>different types of gold jewelry</a> to see why we use gold filled & vermeil.

                                For the most part - yes! Gold filled and sterling silver jewelry can withstand normal wear and tear from showering and sleeping in it. There are a few exceptions to this, however. Our Opal Necklaces should NOT be in contact with water, or it will lose its flash. Anything that is gold plated should not be in contact with water. This includes all of our Gemstone Necklaces.

                                We have the perfect solution - our <a>layered necklace detangler!</a> We wrote an article about <a>how to keep your necklaces from tangling</a> using our detangler. All you have to do is clasp your necklaces onto the detangler clasp, and you can open/close the clasp around your neck! The plus side about this is, you are putting on 2-4 necklaces at once, rather than one at a time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here are a few tips you can use besides the detangler:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Wear different types of chains to prevent tangling (e.g. combine satellite chain with cable chain).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Wear longer/heavier necklaces with shorter/lighter ones.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Unclasp the necklace and hold it from one end to let all the "twists" out, and then re-clasp onto your neck.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                Domestic shipping in the USA should take 2-5 business days via USPS First Class Mail. We do have faster options: USPS Priority should take 2-3 days, and USPS Priority Express should take 1-2 days. Please note: these are estimated times, and are NOT guaranteed by USPS. International shipping takes 7-21 days via USPS First Class International. You can find more info in our <a>Shipping page</a>.

                                You might, depending on where you live. Although most packages go through without any charges, there are some that may incur charges (especially in the UK). Please note that we have no control over how your country charges duty. We are not responsible for paying any customs taxes on international orders.

                                Please note Mejuri cannot issue a refund to a method of payment that is different from the one used to place the order. Upon receiving your returned item at our warehouse, it will take up to 10-15 business days for the returns team to process and send you a return confirmation email.

Should you have cancelled your credit card or reissued a new one, the amount will be transferred by the bank.

                                Each jewelry order comes with a complimentary gift pouch, ready for gift giving. All other pieces in that order will come in a cute peach envelope and a sleeve, which is also ready for gift giving. Add on's by themselves (e.g. detanglers and extenders) do not come with pouches.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Orders don't come with receipts, so you won't have to worry about the recipient knowing the price!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We try to be as sustainable as possible, so we include one complimentary gift pouch per order. If you would like an additional pouch, you can purchase them for $2 here: <a>Extra Gift Pouch</a>
